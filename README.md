<h1>Java Collection Framework</h1>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The Collection Framework is a cornerstone of Java that offers a rich set of interfaces and classes for storing, manipulating, and managing groups of objects. It simplifies data organization and retrieval, promoting efficient and consistent code.</p>

<h3>Key Components:</h3>
<h5>Interfaces:</h5>
<p>These define contracts for common collection behaviors (e.g., Collection, List, Set, Map). Classes implementing these interfaces must provide specific implementations for the methods.</p>

<h5>Classes:</h5>
<p>These provide concrete implementations of the interfaces, with specialized functionalities (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap). Choosing the right class depends on the desired collection behavior (ordered vs. unordered, uniqueness, etc.).</p>

<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<p><b>Abstraction:</b> Interfaces hide the underlying implementation details, allowing you to work with collections generically.</p>
<p><b>Reusability:</b> Common functionalities like adding, removing, searching, and sorting are implemented in the framework, reducing code duplication.</p>
<p><b>Type Safety:</b> Generics in Java collections enforce type safety, preventing runtime errors due to incompatible object types.</p>

<h1>Sorting Algorithms in Java</h1>
<h3>Function:</h3>
<p>Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a collection according to a specific order (ascending or descending), based on a defined comparison criterion.</p>

<h3>Common Sorting Methods:</h3>
<p><b>Arrays.sort():</b> Sorts primitive arrays (int[], double[], etc.) efficiently using a quicksort variant.</p>
<p><b>Collections.sort():</b> Sorts elements in List collections (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList). It uses a hybrid approach, combining merge sort (stable) and timsort (efficient) for optimal performance with various data types.</p>
<p><b>TreeSet:</b> This class itself maintains a sorted order based on the elements' natural ordering or a custom comparator. Adding elements automatically inserts them in the correct sorted position.</p>

<h1>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Sorting Method:</h1>
<p><b>Data Type:</b> Primitive arrays or objects in collections?</p>
<p><b>Collection Type:</b> Ordered (List) or unordered (Set)?</p>
<p><b>Data Size:</b> Performance can vary with data volume.</p>
<p><b>Sorting Order:</b> Ascending or descending?</p>
<p><b>Stability:</b> Does the order of equal elements matter after sorting?</p>
